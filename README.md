<h2> About Me</h2>
<p>
  <img src="Aaliyah Headshot.jpg" width="150px">
My name is Aaliyah Lockett, a senior Computer Science student at the Unsinkable Albany State University, graduating in December 2025, with a strong focus on cybersecurity, software development, and real-world problem solving. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve consistently sought opportunities that bridge the gap between theory and application—from reverse engineering binary files and developing interactive web interfaces to writing and analyzing SQL queries that support critical decision-making.

A few of my experiences include supporting IT operations at Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany (MCLB), where I operated in a mission-critical, security-focused environment, and contributing to behind-the-scenes tech operations at Walt Disney World, where I learned the value of precision, timing, and seamless user experiences on a global scale. These roles, along with my academic projects, have shaped my approach: analytical, adaptive, and always mission-focused.

I’ve worked with languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript, and have built systems that are not just functional, but thoughtful—designed with user experience, clarity, and security in mind. Whether developing cybersecurity strategies with blockchain, debugging web functionality, or supporting team collaboration, I approach each challenge with precision, persistence, and a genuine passion for technology’s potential to do good.
