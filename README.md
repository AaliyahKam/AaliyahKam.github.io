<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  Hi! I'm Aaliyah Lockett — a senior Computer Science student at the Unsinkable Albany State University, graduating in December 2025, with a strong focus on cybersecurity, software development, and real-world problem solving.
</p>
<p>
  Throughout my academic journey, I’ve consistently sought opportunities that bridge the gap between theory and application — from reverse engineering binary files and developing interactive web interfaces to writing and analyzing SQL queries that support critical decision-making.
</p>
<p>
  A few of my experiences include supporting IT operations at Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany (MCLB), where I operated in a mission-critical, security-focused environment, and contributing to the behind-the-scenes tech operations at Walt Disney World, where I learned the value of precision, timing, and seamless user experiences on a global scale.
</p>
<p>
  These roles, along with my academic projects, have shaped my approach: analytical, adaptive, and always mission-focused.
