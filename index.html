      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
My name is Aaliyah Lockett, a senior Computer Science student at the Unsinkable Albany State University, graduating in December 2025, with a strong focus on cybersecurity, software development, and real-world problem solving. Throughout my academic journey, Iâ€™ve consistently sought opportunities that bridge the gap between theory and applicationâ€”from reverse engineering binary files and developing interactive web interfaces to writing and analyzing SQL queries that support critical decision-making. 
A few of my experiences include supporting IT operations at Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany (MCLB), where I operated in a mission-critical, security-focused environment, and contributing to behind-the-scenes tech operations at Walt Disney World, where I learned the value of precision, timing, and seamless user experiences on a global scale. These roles, along with my academic projects, have shaped my approach: analytical, adaptive, and always mission-focused.
Iâ€™ve worked with languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript, and have built systems that are not just functional, but thoughtfulâ€”designed with user experience, clarity, and security in mind. Whether developing cybersecurity strategies with blockchain, debugging web functionality, or supporting team collaboration, I approach each challenge with precision, persistence, and a genuine passion for technologyâ€™s potential to do good.
